# Summary

BlenDaViz is a 3d plotting library for the visualization tool Blender, written in Python.
It is able to visualize line plots, scatter plots, surfaces,
iso-surfaces, glyphs (arrows) and streamlines from Numpy arrays.
The user can load BlenDaViz within a Blender Python console as any other library.
Its design is close to other plotting libraries, especially Matplotlib, which means that
every part of a plot is treated as an object that can be changed when updating the plot
with new parameters or data.
Compared to other 3d visualization software, we achieve higher image quality, thanks to Blender's
ray tracing capabilities.


# Statement of need

In scientific fields, like structure mechanics, computational fluid dynamics,
astrophysics, or molecular dynamics, it is common to use 3d visualization tools
like [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) [@Ahrens2005],
[Vapor](https://www.vapor.ucar.edu) [@vapor],
[Mayavi](https://pypi.org/project/mayavi) or
[Visit](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit).
They are capable to load a variety of data formats and visualize different
aspects of the data using filters.
However, they often lack the image quality needed that would make understanding
the data easy.
Their limited shaders can create optical illusions where the depth of the geometry
is not clear, or the colors are off due to unrealistic image generation.

Realistically rendered or ray-traced images, like those generated by 3d
modelling tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org), not only improve the image
quality, but make it easier to understand the three-dimensional structure
and colors.
For instance, contextually-implied scattered light can have a significant impact
on the perceived color of objects, as exemplified by `The Dress' controversy~\cite{chetverikov2016seeing}.
Using lighting, shadow, depth and scattering can be used to generate photorealistic images
where the interpretation is made easier.

So far Blender has seen only limited use in 3d data visualization.
[Bioblender](http://www.bioblender.org) has been developed specifically
for biological data and requires significant Blender knowledge.
Similarly, suggestions to use Blender in Astrophysics [@Kent-2015]
require the generation of the geometry by hand.
High quality plots by the Oak [Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2011/08/03/ornl-animations-garner-peer-praise-and-prizes)
shows that to achieve high quality a collaboration between Blender experts and
scientists is sometimes required.

Attempts to libraries we made with
[AstroBlend](https://www.astroblend.com) [@NAIMAN201650]
and [BlenderSciViz](https://github.com/zeffii/BlenderSciViz),
but their applications are relatively limited and they have not been maintained in years.
Perhaps [BVtkNodes](https://github.com/simboden/BVtkNodes) stands out,
as it is able to load VTK data and apply filters on it.

With [BlenDaViz](https://github.com/SimonCan/BlenDaViz)
we give the users all the rendering and ray tracing
capabilities of Blender, combined with the ease of use and modularity we know
from libraries like Matplotlib.
It is general purpose, thanks to the implementation of some of the most
used 3d plotting methods.
